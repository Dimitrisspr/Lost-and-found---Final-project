# Lost-and-found
The purpose of this app is to help pet owners that lost their pet reunite with them again. If the user lost his/her pet or found a pet, he can declare it in our app, among with a photo of the pet, some characteristics of it, the place he lost/found it and the date of that. The most importart characteristic of our app is that the pet owner will get informed by email when his/her pet is found. The owner of the lost pet can also use our app to check if his/her pet is already found. Its important to mention that the app is just a way for the community to help each other on finding the lost pets.
